# Regional-Unemployment-in-the-US--Tableau-Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing regional and state-level unemployment trends in the United States, with a focused comparison between 2023 and 2024. The dashboard combines labor market indicators with geographic and temporal analysis to highlight disparities, changes, and emerging patterns across regions.


The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the U.S. labor market by examining:

* Unemployment rates
* Labor force participation rates
* Dependency ratios
* Year-over-year changes (2023 vs 2024)

It enables users to compare regions, identify states with rising unemployment or dependency ratios, and explore relationships between labor force participation and employment outcomes.

Key Insights:

* Unemployment rates vary notably across regions and divisions.

* Certain states show a significant year-over-year increase in unemployment.

* Changes in labor force participation do not always move in tandem with employment rates.

* States with rising dependency ratios may face increased economic pressure on the working population.
